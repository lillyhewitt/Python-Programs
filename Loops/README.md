1 Number of Vowels
Write a function which, given a String, returns the total number of vowels that
were in the String. This means you need to feed the function you write a String
as a parameter and return an integer.

2 Number of Even Digits
Write a function which, given an int, return the number of even digits in the
int. For example, if the function is passed the number 254, it should return 2,
as only two of the digits are even. You will need to use modulus and division to
solve the problem. The strategies you use here will help you develop solutions
for the next two problems.

3 Three Digit Armstrong Numbers
A Three Digit Armstrong Number is an integer such that the sum of the cube of
each digit is equal to the whole number. Write a function that, given an integer
as a parameter, returns whether or not a number is a Three Digit Armstrong
Number. Some examples of Armstrong Numbers:
371 = 33 + 73 + 1
370 = 33 + 73 + 03

4 Riddler
Holy digits Batman! The Riddler is planning his next caper somewhere on
Pennsylvania Avenue. In his usual sporting fashion, he has left the address in
the form of a puzzle. The address on Pennsylvania is a four-digit number with
the following properties:
• All four digits are different
• The digit in the thousands place is three times the digit in the tens place
• The number is odd
• The sum of the digits is 27.
Write a function that uses a loop or loops that returns the address where
the Riddler plans to strike.
