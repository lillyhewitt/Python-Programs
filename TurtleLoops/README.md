For each of the following problems, write small program that uses turtles to
draw the figure.

1 Turtle Olympics
Write a program (or function if you know how) which uses a turtle or turtles
to draw the Olympic ring logo. Extra credit if you can get the rings to overlap
and cross over and under correctly.

2 Turtle Clock
Draw the face of analog clock using a turtle. It should resemble the following
picture, but you can be creative! Remember the stamp() function a turtle can
use, as well as penup().
Figure 1: A clock of turtles.

3 Initials
Write a program or function that draws your initials.

4 Draw Shape
Write a program that asks a user to input the number of sides they would like,
which we’ll call n. Your turtle should then draw an n-sided regular polygon, i.e.
a shape with n sides that all are the same size and all the angles are the same
angle. In other words, if n is 3, then your turtle will draw an equilateral triangle.
If n is 4, your turtle should draw a square. If n is 5, you have a pentagon with
all sides the same. And so on. Please refrain from using the built-in circle
function turtles come with.
My hints are as follow
 You should have a for loop that runs n times.
 All the angles in the shape will add up to 360 degrees.
